# NguyenNotes

After reading the request, I imagine an application will have two screens. I decided to create 2 activities. After successful implementation. I think I can improve using the compose navigation. However, using intentFor() also makes the source code easier to understand.

I think the hardest thing for me doing this project was spending a lot of time building Jetpack Compose's UI.

I spent 6 hours on the application.
My target is the best of my function so I completed 3 part of Backlog and I spent a little time writing the test function.
